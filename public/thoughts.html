                    There are many reasons people like to drink coffee….Some are for the taste, others just drink it to
                    possibly fit in with their social circles… Whatever the case may be, there are quite a few reasons
                    Why “I” drink coffee :P<br>
                    1) It keeps me sane<br>
                    2) It helps me function through my crazy days at work<br>
                    3) It helps me to not kill people, while at work :P (very important)<br>
                    4) It keeps me awake…. especially when I consume like 5 or 6 a day….mostly :P<br>
                    5) I like the taste<br>
                    6) It keeps me warm….especially in the winter months….or in the summer months it can keep me cool as
                    well… MMMmmmm Iced Coffee :P<br>
                    7) It keeps me sane…..ooops, Did i already say that? LOL<br>
                    So the bottom line…. I drink my coffee because if I don’t, bad things will happen…. I’m afraid, but
                    it’s true…..Oh and also, If I don’t drink my coffee dailly, I get the mad shakes…. WITHDRAWL…. Not
                    such a good thing :(<br>
                    Happy Drinking Everyone :)

                    Friendship to me means quite a lot!! I tend to be too open to frienships sometimes, and sometimes it
                    turns around and bites me in the ass…. but for the most part I have good “gut instincts” when it
                    comes to making friends. I have been fairly lucky in this department (knock on wood…lol) Some people
                    may think I’m crazy for opening up and being too “trustworthy”, I guess you could say, and YES, I do
                    wear my heart on my sleeve and it shows… but to me, that’s just the kind of person I am. Always have
                    and always will. I guess it’s just a part of how I was raised. I was always taught to befriend
                    everyone in my path, because there is a lot you can learn from everyone you meet… Some “friends” can
                    turn around and stab you in the back, and believe me, I’ve had my share of those “friends” and I use
                    that term loosely when it comes to those individuals. I also have to credit those “friends” for
                    making me stronger making me grow even more as the individual I have become today! I believe
                    everyone deserves at least one chance… and if they choose to not want to be a part of my life, then
                    that was their choice to make and who am I to judge?? Does that make me stupid for wanting to
                    believe that everyone has some good in them? I hope not….lol… but then again, maybe I am. All I know
                    is that I truly “love” ALL my friends from the bottom of my heart and if I end up getting hurt by
                    some of them, then I have only myself to blame for that… and to be honest…I’m ok with that :) XXX

                    It is by chance we met, by choice we became friends. Friendship is a strange thing…we find ourselves
                    telling eachother the deepest details of our lives, things we don’t even share with our families who
                    raised us. But what is a friend? A confidant? A lover? A fellow e-mail junkie? A shoulder to cry on?
                    An ear to listen? A heart to feel?
                    A friend is all these things…..and more. No matter where we met, I call you friend. A word so small
                    yet so large in feeling, a word filled with emotion.
                    It is true that great things come in small packages. Once the package of friendship has been opened,
                    it can never be closed. It is a constant book always written waiting to be read and enjoyed. We may
                    have our disagreements, we may argue, we may concern one another…. Friendship is a unique bond that
                    lasts through it all.
                    A part of me is put into my friends. Some of it is my humour, some of it is my listening ear, some
                    of it is real life experiences, some of it is my romanticism, but with all it is friendship.

                    I strive to be the best person I can be. Sure, I have my faults and have failed on numerous
                    occasions, but who hasn’t? Nobody is perfect, and those who think otherwise, obviously have their
                    head in the clouds. That doesn’t mean you can’t strive for perfection, or possibly be somebody
                    else’s idea of “perfect”. To me, all of my friends and family, in some way are “perfect”. They are
                    “perfect” in their jobs, their surroundings and most importantly, by just being themselves. Some may
                    struggle more than others, but it’s the way they pick themselves back up and emerge from their
                    faults, that constitute “perfection” in my eyes.

                    I’ve been sitting here in the same spot for a while, bored out of my tree and contemplating this
                    thing called “life”.
                    What exactly constitutes a life?
                    This may seem like a weird question to ask, and I know the logical answer would be “to be amongst
                    the living”, or somewhat. I mean, I know you don’t have to be in the here and now to be considered
                    having a “life”, there have been a lot of people, animals and “things” that have come and gone in
                    this world, that at some point had a “life”. But what else constitutes a “life”, other than
                    breathing? Do you have to have a high paying job? Be drop dead gorgeous? Have lots of friends? or
                    Smarts even?
                    I ask this, because I am constantly hearing people say the phrase “Get a life” to other human,
                    breathing beings and I am somewhat confused by this whole expression.
                    Do these people not think they are talking to an actual person with a “life”? Am I just that stupid
                    to think that every living creature on the face of this planet, in the here and now or those that
                    have passed, do in fact have a “life” and it’s completely up to them in how they live their lives?

                    I honestly wish sometimes I didn’t go through life wearing my heart on my sleeve. I tend to develop
                    relationships with people far too easilly and I end up getting hurt in the long run. I let my
                    emotions take over my mind and body and before I know it, I’m invested in all these friendships that
                    mean way more to me than they do to the people I have grown to love in some way. To some, this may
                    not be a bad quality to have in life….but to me I find it makes life that much harder just knowing
                    that I will probably more than likely get hurt in the end. I’m not saying I don’t have wonderful
                    friends who I know would do anything for me, because I do….Probably more than I can count, which is
                    awesome….I love each and every one of them dearly. But at the same time, it doesn’t take the pain
                    away knowing that the other people in my life I have grown to love with all my heart don’t return
                    the same feelings for me. I know I may not be the smartest or prettiest girl, but I believe I make
                    up for all of that with my compassion for others and I honestly wish people would see that not
                    everyone they meet in life is going to turn into a bad apple on them. Maybe that’s part of the
                    problem….. maybe some of these friends I have grown to love have just been hurt too much in the past
                    and don’t want to take the risk of opening up in fear that I too will turn on them in some way. What
                    these people need to realize though is I have never and will never turn my back on someone who needs
                    me as much as I need them. That’s what friendship is all about.

                    Respect is basically an attitude that is shown towards any individuals’ feelings or interest. It is
                    acknowledging another’s feelings in any kind of relationship. It may not necessarily be feelings
                    shared between individuals but could also be referred to animals, groups or between countries. It
                    implies to the phrase “treat others the way you want to be treated.” I believe everyone deserves to
                    be respected, especially celebrities. Imagine going through life in their shoes for a change. Always
                    having people follow them around everywhere they go, taking pictures, asking for autographs… It must
                    get quite exhausting! I know if it were me, I would at least hope there would be some decent people
                    out in the world that would allow me some privacy and much deserved respect.
                    I’m not saying I’m perfect in any regards to this very subject. I do try my best to give as much
                    respect to everyone I know and talk to on a daily basis, but are there times I wish I had not said
                    things and maybe disrespected someone that I had no intention of doing? Yes, and I’m not proud of
                    that, but everyone makes mistakes, and I’m willing to learn from those mistakes and hopefully become
                    a better person because of it.
                    Please just learn to respect everyone around you and treat them as you would want to be treated.
                    This world would be a much better place :)

                    Tattoos are more than just pictures, or symbols plastered on peoples bodies. Tattoos are a form of
                    art that if done correctly and at a tasteful level, can actually look quite amazing and attractive
                    to ones eye. I don’t necessarily agree with plastering your body with tattoos, but one or two, in
                    areas of the body that maybe aren’t always noticeable by everyone in sight is not a bad thing by any
                    measure. I believe tattoos should have meaning behind them, and not just for the sake of saying
                    “Hey, look at me, I have a tattoo” just to be cool.. I am not against tattoos in any way.. I do have
                    one myself… It is a multicoloured butterfly on my right shoulder.. The reason I picked a butterfly
                    is not because it is “cute” or the normal type of tattoo a girl would get….lol.. I chose a butterfly
                    because to me it represents new life, in the present, as well as the “after life”. Just like a
                    caterpillar eventually turns into this beautiful creature over time, and is given a second chance at
                    life…I believe when a person passes from this world, they too are given a second chance at living in
                    a place more beautiful than any one of us could ever imagine possible.

                    Music means so much to me…A day does not pass without me listening to some sort of music, and if it
                    did, I would probably go insane….lol. To me, music is more than just turning on the radio for the
                    sake of filling up the silence in the room or car… To me, music means connecting with your heart and
                    soul and allowing your emotions to take over your body. Whether you are in a good mood, sad mood, in
                    the mood for love, or just plain pissy mood, there is always a song that you will find that has a
                    deep connection to how you are feeling at the moment. Like one of my favourite quotes says “Music is
                    the gateway to the soul” and it is very, very true in my case.
